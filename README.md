### Project Overview

This project analyzes disaster events affecting America (North, Central, and South America) between 2018 and 2024.
The objective is to understand:
* Trends and patterns in disasters
* Human and economic impacts
* Response efficiency
* Recovery dynamics
* The effectiveness of predictive modeling for disaster outcomes

The analysis focuses exclusively on disaster events occurring in American countries extracted from a global dataset.

### Purpose and Expected Outcomes
####Purpose

To evaluate disaster frequency, severity, response behavior, and recovery timelines in America by leveraging statistical analysis, data visualization, and various prediction models.

#### Outcomes

Insights into the most severe and frequent disaster types
Trends in economic losses and casualties
Response efficiency patterns
Predictive models estimating recovery days and response efficiency
Clear, data-driven recommendations for improving disaster response strategies
